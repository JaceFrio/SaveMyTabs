# SaveMyTabs
Save My Tabs is a simple Chrome extension that saves your tabs for later use. 

## How It Works

Your saved tabs are synced to your Google account so that you can access your saved tabs from anywhere.

Like grouping your tabs? Save My Tabs will keep your tabs grouped together when you save and load them. 

Match your Chrome theme using the color theme customization options in the extension.

## Notes
This extension currently isn't published as there are multiple improvements that I would like to make.

## TODOs
- ~~Update savedTabs.js to completely use jQuery.~~
- ~~Update color customization to a toggle between color theme and font color.~~
- ~~Update tab session css to show grouping better.~~
- Add size options for saved tab groups, i.e. small, medium, or large.
- ~~Add color box showing the current selected color.~~
- Update color settings so that users can't select the same color for both options.
- Update colorOneText class name and related variable names OR implement two color selection option for making gradients.
