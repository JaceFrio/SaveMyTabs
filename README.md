# SaveMyTabs
Save My Tabs is a simple Chrome extension that saves your tabs for later use. 

## How It Works

Your saved tabs are synced to your Google account so that you can access your saved tabs from anywhere.

Like grouping your tabs? Save My Tabs will keep your tabs grouped together when you save and load them. 

Match your Chrome theme using the color theme customization options in the extension.
